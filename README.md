# 👋 Hi, I'm Herbert Steindl

I work at the intersection of requirements and implementation.
My focus is on technical structuring, automation and pragmatic solutions – especially in environments where reliability and maintainability matter.

## 🔧 What I do

- Design and implement process automations
- Create clean, understandable logic structures
- Support organizations in reducing manual work
- Build and test technical solutions with long-term usability

---

## 🧠 Areas of experience

- Automation (logic-based and event-driven)
- Systems integration and data flow design
- Process standardization and error minimization
- Technical consulting in practical environments

---

## ⚙️ Philosophy

Less noise, more structure. I aim for solutions that do their job quietly and well – with as little overhead as possible.
